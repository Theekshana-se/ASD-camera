## Diagnosis
- The backend returns 400 with message "Invalid product data submitted" generated by the catch block in server/controllers/products.js:381–385 when Prisma throws a validation error on create.
- We recently added new fields `isFeatured` and `isHotDeal` to the product payload (admin form) and controller (server/controllers/products.js:356–375 and 448–451). If the Prisma client was not regenerated after schema changes, Prisma will reject these unknown arguments, causing the validation error.
- There is a schema mismatch: root Prisma schema (prisma/schema.prisma) includes `discount` (line ~23) and after our planned change should include `isFeatured`/`isHotDeal`; server Prisma schema (server/prisma/schema.prisma) previously lacked `discount`. The server uses `@prisma/client` built from the root schema via server/utills/db.js:5, so the client must be regenerated to include new fields.

## Plan
1. Regenerate Prisma client so new fields are recognized
   - Run `npx prisma generate` from the project root so `@prisma/client` includes `isFeatured` and `isHotDeal` (and `discount`).
   - Ensure both `prisma/schema.prisma` and `server/prisma/schema.prisma` are consistent. Prefer the root schema as the source of truth.
2. Restart backend server
   - Restart the Express server at `http://localhost:3001` so it loads the freshly generated Prisma client.
3. Verify product creation
   - Submit a product with all required fields: `merchantId`, `slug`, `title`, `price`, `categoryId`, `manufacturer`, `description`, `mainImage`, optional `coverPhoto`, `brandId`.
   - Include new booleans if needed: `isOfferItem`, `isFeatured`, `isHotDeal`.
   - Expect `201` with created product. If not, capture the exact Prisma error (temporarily log `error.message` and `error.code`) to pinpoint any remaining mismatch.
4. Frontend alignment
   - The admin form already sends the new flags (app/(dashboard)/admin/products/new/page.tsx:338–396). After backend fix, no UI change is required for creation.
5. Home sections integration (next step after backend works)
   - Featured: GET `/api/products?filters[isFeatured][$equals]=true&sort=defaultSort&page=1`.
   - Hot deals: GET `/api/products?filters[isHotDeal][$equals]=true&sort=defaultSort&page=1`.
   - Limited-time offers (existing): GET `/api/products?filters[isOfferItem][$equals]=true&sort=defaultSort&page=1`.

## Verification
- Create a sample product and confirm `201`.
- Fetch admin list `GET /api/products?mode=admin` and see the new product with flags.
- Fetch featured and hot deals lists with filters above and confirm correct results.

## What caused the issue
- Prisma client was out of date relative to the schema changes (unknown arguments `isFeatured`/`isHotDeal`), triggering the validation error that the controller wraps as "Invalid product data submitted" (server/controllers/products.js:381–385).

Please confirm and I will execute the steps and validate end-to-end.
