# Contact Page Redesign - 2026 Futuristic Style ✅

## Overview
The Contact Us page (`/contact`) has been completely redesigned to match the animations and aesthetic of the About Us page.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Hero Section**
- **Parallax Background**: Uses `framer-motion` for a smooth parallax effect on the hero image.
- **Particle Effects**: Floating animated particles in the background.
- **Gradient Overlay**: Dark overlay for text readability.
- **Animated Typography**: Staggered text animations for "Contact Us" title.

### 2. **Interactive Info Cards**
- **Hover Effects**: Cards lift up (`y: -10`) and display a gradient corner effect on hover.
- **Icon Animation**: Icons rotate 360 degrees when hovering over the card.
- **Modern Gradients**: four different gradient themes for Phone, Email, Location, and Hours.

### 3. **Contact Form**
- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle background styling.
- **Floating Inputs**: Modern styled inputs with focus rings.
- **Animated Button**: Submit button changes state (Loading spinner -> Success checkmark) with smooth transitions.

### 4. **Map & Layout**
- **Split Layout**: Form on the left, visual elements on the right.
- **Styled Map Placeholder**: CSS-generated grid pattern (no external image dependency).
- **Animated Pin**: Pulsing location marker.
- **Glass Card**: "Why Visit Us" section with backdrop blur and gradient background.

## Key Technologies
- **Framer Motion**: For all animations (`fadeInUp`, `staggerContainer`, `whileHover`).
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling, gradients, and responsiveness.
- **React Icons**: `fa6` icon set.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
The page is fully responsive, animated, and integrates perfectly with the site's modern theme.
