# Promotions Management Update ✅

## Implemented Changes
1.  **Sidebar Rename**: changed "Banners" to "Promotions" in the admin sidebar for clarity.
2.  **Image Upload**: Added ability to upload images directly from your device in the Admin Panel. It now supports both:
    - 📁 **File Upload** (Drag & drop or click to select)
    - 🔗 **URL Input** (For external images)
3.  **Default Settings**: New promotions default to showing on the "Promotion Page".
4.  **Admin UI**: Updated the header and texts to reflect "Promotions Control" instead of "Banners".

## How to Test
1.  Go to Admin Dashboard.
2.  Click **Promotions** in the sidebar.
3.  Click "Click to upload image" and select a file from your computer.
4.  Wait for the green "Image ready" confirmation.
5.  Click "Publish Promotion".
6.  Go to `http://localhost:3000/promotions` to see your new banner live!
